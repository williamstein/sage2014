Notation: <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> 'What we enter into sage' (note, we do not enter the 'sage:' part) <br>
>>> 'The result that is returned by sage' <br>
<br>
To create a matrix in sage, say matrix A, we type <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> A = matrix([[1,2,3],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]]) <br>
To put it another way <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> A = matrix([[comma separated list of row 1], [comma separated list of row 2], . . . ,[comma separated list of the last row]]) <br>
Notice that the lists of rows are enclosed by a set of square braces in addition to the encloseing parentheses. <br>
To see the matrix we just entered in human form, type <br>
<font color = 'green'>sage:</font color> show(A) <br>
